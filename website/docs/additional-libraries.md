A technique to not lose sight on the long-term vision.

1. **Prioritize design spikes:** Evaluate the importance of each design spike and prioritize them based on their potential impact on the product's success. This will help you determine which spikes need to be addressed first.
1. **Limit the scope:** Define the scope of the design spike to only what is necessary to validate the concept or design. This will help you focus on the most critical aspects and avoid getting sidetracked.
1. **Iterate quickly:** Prioritize speed over perfection and iterate quickly on design concepts. This can help you move faster and make progress on the design spike within the tight sprint timeline.
1. **Collaborate with stakeholders:** Involve stakeholders early in the design spike process to ensure everyone is on the same page and to avoid misunderstandings. This can help prevent rework later on.
1. **Use prototyping tools:** Use rapid prototyping tools that allow you to quickly mockup and iterate on ideas. This can help you explore design options and validate concepts faster.
1. **Test with real users:** Conduct user testing to gather feedback and insights from your target audience, validate whether the design meets their needs, identify areas for improvement, and ensure the potential impact on product success.

Ultimately, after user testing, design spikes will generate new task to the backlog to define full journeys, unhappy paths and all the required deliverables, this tasks will then be prioritised agains the other backlog items.
